                <h2>Poore vatan ka Ratan</h2>
                <p><b>Ratan Naval Tata</b> (28 December 1937 â€“ 9 October 2024) was an Indian industrialist and
                    philanthropist. He served as the chairman of Tata Group and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and he held
                    the position of interim chairman from October 2016 to February 2017. In 2000, he received the
                    Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honor in India, followed by the Padma Vibhushan, the
                    country's second highest civilian honor, in 2008.</p>
                <p>Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamshedji Tata, the
                    founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from Cornell University College of Architecture with a
                    bachelor's degree in architecture. He had also attended the Harvard Business School (HBS) Advanced
                    Management program in 1975. He joined the Tata Group in 1962, starting on the shop floor of Tata
                    Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in
                    1991. During his tenure, the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt
                    to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business.</p>

                <p>Throughout his life, Tata invested in over 40 start-ups, primarily in a personal capacity, with
                    additional investments through his firm, RNT Capital Advisors.</p>
